The Eerie Mansion is a text based Choose Your Own Adventure 
Game played directly in the terminal. You, the protagonist 
need to make predetermined choices that control your actions 
and the plots outcome. The mechanics are simple, explicitly 
follow the directions given in the terminal and input the correct 
values using your keyboard. The game consists of three levels played 
on three floors respectively. The aim is to escape the mansion 
unscathed.

Level 1️⃣ :

The starting floor requires you to manoeuvre through the mansion 
by choosing different doors. Be careful though, some paths are 
misleading and will cause you to die. In the event of losing, you 
will be redirected to the start of the level. The same door rules 
apply to the next two levels. Note there are some clues to help you 
along your quest.

Level 2️⃣ : 

The second floor consist of more path choices but this time mixed 
in with a horror quiz. Here, you will be introduced to your 10 health
points. Each question you get wrong means a life will be deducted. In 
the event of your life points reaching 0, the game over will initiate, 
meaning you would need to start from the welcome screen. 

Level 3️⃣ :

The final floor includes more path traversing but in addition to 
random number guessing. This means you will need to guess the number 
each door expects of you. Again, if you get an answer wrong and reach 0 
lives, the game will start over from the very beginning. 

Good luck adventurer. Remember to follow the clues and underlying theme 
of the game to succeed. Be careful and most importantly have fun.
