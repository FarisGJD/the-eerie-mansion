The Haunted Mansion is a text based Choose Your Own Adventure Game 
played directly in the terminal. You, the protagonist need to make 
predetermined choices that control your actions and the plots outcome. 
The mechanics are simple, follow the directions given and input the 
correct values using your keyboard. The game consists of three levels
played on three different floors respectively. The aim is to escape 
the mansion unscathed. 

Level 1️⃣ :

The starting floor requires you to manoeuvre through the mansion, 
choosing between different doors to enter. Be careful though, 
some paths are misleading and will cause you to die. 
In the event of losing, you will be redirected to the start 
of the level. Note there are some clues and easters eggs to 
help you along your quest. 

Level 2️⃣ : 

The second floor consist of more path choice but this time mixed 
in with a horror quiz. In this floor you will be introduced to your 
10 health points. Each question you get wrong means a life will be 
deducted. In the event of reaching 0, the game over will initiate, 
meaning you would need to start from the welcome screen. 

Level 3️⃣ :

The final floor includes more path traversing but in addition to 
random number guessing. This means you will need to guess the number 
each door requires of you. Again, if you get an answer wrong and 
reach 0 lives, the game will start from the very begging. 

Good luck adventurer. Be careful and most importantly have fun.
