The Biography of Dr. Charles Falken: 

Dr Falken was the world’s leading scientist in the field of genetic 
engineering. His aim was to manipulate and modify the genes or 
hereditary makeup of microorganisms, plants and eventually animals to 
better understand and aid the human genome.In doing so he intended to 
transfer a beneficial gene from one organism to another in order to 
develop disease resistance in people. 

He began his experiments on various animals and exotic vegetation in a 
small practice based in London. This proved to be useful as he stumbled 
across the benefits of spider venom. His studies showed that vast 
quantities of said venom could act as a conduit in interspecies gene 
transfer. 

Exited he showed his findings to his colleagues but was shocked at the 
dismay and ridicule he received. This is because genetic engineering on 
humans is illegal in the UK meaning his life’s work was in vain. Angry he
decided to take matters into his own hands. He purchased an estate in the 
Lake District where he could be safe to conduct his human trials. 

As news broke out police immediately shut down his practice forcing Dr 
Falken to go on the run. Currently no one knows his whereabouts.
