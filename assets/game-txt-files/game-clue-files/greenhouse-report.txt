Human trials have been a success with some setbacks. Patient 154 
has successfully taken to the conduit venom or “Chemical X” although 
his mutation is an issue. Too little of the venom has caused spiders
legs, fangs and multiple eyes to protrude from his body. This means 
vast amounts of venom is needed to stop the undesirable side effects. 
The spiders will therefore need to be genetically engineered to be 
larger and more bountiful.
