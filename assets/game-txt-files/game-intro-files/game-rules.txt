The Eerie Mansion is a text based Choose Your Own Adventure 
Game played directly in the terminal. You, the protagonist 
need to make predetermined choices that control your actions 
and the plots outcome. The mechanics are simple, explicitly 
follow the directions given in the terminal and input the correct 
values using your keyboard. The game consists of three levels played 
on three floors respectively. The aim is to escape the mansion 
unscathed.

Level 1️⃣ :

The starting floor requires you to manoeuvre through the mansion 
by choosing different doors. Be careful though, some paths are 
misleading and will cause you to be injured or trapped. In this 
case, you will be redirected to the start of the level. Note there 
are some clues to help you along your quest.

Level 2️⃣ : 

The second floor consists of more path choices but this time mixed 
in with a horror quiz. The quiz is purely for fun and to test your horror 
knowledge. However, the path choices have the same rules as before. If 
you choose the wrong door, you will be redirected to the start of the level, 
initiating the quiz again.

Level 3️⃣ :

The final floor is where you will be introduced to your 5 life points.
Here you will meet your final obstacle which is a random number guessing. 
This means you will need to guess the number the door expects of you. However, 
if your life reaches 0, a game over will commence, meaning you will start 
from the welcome screen.

Good luck adventurer. Remember to follow the clues and underlying theme 
of the game to succeed. Be careful and most importantly have fun.
