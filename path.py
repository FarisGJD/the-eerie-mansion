            \rinside. You look around to find a lone door ahead, with no way
            \rback or alternate path. You have no choice but to enter.\n
            \rYou walk inside and struggle to see anything. You remember the
            \rdamaged switch board and begin to worry. Could the rest of your
            \rjourney be in virtual darkness? While walking around you trip
            \rover an object. You go back to inspect it. By a stroke of luck,
            \ryou find a flash light. You will finally be able to see. There
            \rare two doors in front of you.\n"""
